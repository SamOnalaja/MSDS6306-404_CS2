Objective: Predict employee turnover for talent management by conducting analysis of existing employee data
1) Determine factors that lead to attrition
2) Identify at least 3 factors that contribute to turnover with/without derived attributes/variables
3) Identify any job role's specific trends, e.g. “Data Scientists have the highest job satisfaction”
4) Provide any other interesting trends and observations
5) Document experimentation and visualizations
6) Build a model to predict attrition

Deliverables:
1) A model that will attain at least 60% accuracy for the training and the validation set 
2) A prediction file, “Case2PredictionsXXXX.csv”, ordered by ID where 'XXXX' is (individual or team members') last name?
3) RMarkdown file containing an executive summary, introduction to project, code and analysis
4) Group presentation slides (one deck per team?)
5) Link to YouTube recording in RMarkdown file (joint or individual recording?) 
6) Link to GitHub repo via space provided in Case Study 02 page in 2DS
